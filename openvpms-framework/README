
========================
Preparing your workspace
========================
1. Edit/create build.properties and add properties for the database. E.g:

hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
hibernate.connection.driver_class=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openvpms
hibernate.connection.username=openvpms
hibernate.connection.password=openvpms

2. Copy the file test/conf/log4j/log4j.properties.sample to 
   test/conf/log4j/log4j.properties. You can then change this file to 
   suit your logging needs since it isn't under source control
   
   
======================      
Preparing the database
======================
1. Create a database called 'openvpms'

2. Execute 'maven hibernate:schema-export to create the appropriate tables in
   the database. NOTE: THIS WILL DELETE DROP AND RECREATE THE TABLES
   
   
================
Database Testing
================
The opemnvpms-framework component has been tested with mysql 5.0.24 and the
associated driver jdbc driver 5.0.0-beta-bin.
