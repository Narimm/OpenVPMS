Preparing your workspace
========================
1. Copy the file src/conf/hibernate/hibernate.properties.sample to 
   src/conf/hibernate/hibernate.properties and uncomment or set the 
   appropriate propertis for the database. 
   
2. Copy the file test/conf/log4j/log4j.properties.sample to 
   test/conf/log4j/log4j.properties. You can then change this file to 
   suit your logging needs since it isn't under source control
   
   
======================      
Preparing the database
======================
1. Create a database called 'openvpms'

2. Execute 'maven hibernate:schema-export to create the appropriate tables in
   the database. NOTE: THIS WILL DELETE DROP AND RECREATE THE TABLES
   
   
================
Database Testing
================
The opemnvpms-framework component has been tested with mysql v4.1.13a and the 
associated driver jdbc driver 3.2.0-alpha-bin.
