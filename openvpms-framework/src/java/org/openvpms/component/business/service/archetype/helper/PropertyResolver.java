/**
 * Resolves values from an object given a naming scheme of the form
 * <tt>property1.property2.propertyN</tt>.
 * <p/>
 * Where a property refers to an {@code IMObjectReference}, or a collection
 * of 0..1 IMObject instances, these will be treated as an {@code IMObject}.
 * e.g. given an {@code Act} object, with archetype act.customerEstimation,
 * the field name <em>customer.entity.name</em>, this will:
 * <ul>
 * <li>get the {@code Participation} instance corresponding to the
 * "customer" node</li>
 * <li>get the Entity instance corresponding to the "entity" node of the
 * Participation</li>
 * <li>get the value of the "name" node of the entity.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * When an {@link IMObject} is resolved, several special property names are
 * defined:
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>shortName</em> - returns the value of the archetypes short name</li>
 * <li><em>displayName</em> - returns the value of the archetypes display
 * name</li>
 * </ul>
 * These are only evaluated when they appear as leaf nodes and the archetype
 * corresponding to the leaf has doesn't define the node.
