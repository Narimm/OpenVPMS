/**
 * All OpenVPMS exceptions must extend {@link java.lang.RuntimeException} and 
 * implement this interface. We are opting to used unchecked over checked 
 * exceptions but to declare them both in the javadoc and the method sinature. 
 * The client is then responsible for deciding whether or not to handle the 
 * exception. If there is a need to define a checked exception then it still 
 * must extend this interface
 * <p>
 * The errorCode that is passed to the constructors is a enumerated type which
 * is then used to retrieve a message from a resource file. 
 * <p>
 * In most cases the exception will be handled at the top of each tier (i.e.
 * business, presentation tier). Some messages may require parameters to be
 * passed in before they can be rendered as strings. There are several
 * constructors to support this feature.
