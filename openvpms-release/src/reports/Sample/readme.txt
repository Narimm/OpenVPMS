The samples here provide various patient, customer and supplier letters and forms.

Most are Open Office (.odt) documents, but Sample Patient Form.jrxml and Sample Rabies Certificate.jrxml
are Jasper Reports templates.

The Sample Patient Document.odt contains more complex examples.  It can be used as either a Patient Form or
a Patient Letter - or in fact any other Report Type.

Sample Patient Document.doc is a Microsoft Word document that mimics most of Sample Patient Document.odt.
It does illustrate that although you can use Word to prepare patient etc letters and forms, Open Office
is more powerful. (This is because OpenVPMS used Open Office to process .doc content, but does not implement
all of the mailmerge features available in Word.)

Sample Rabies Certificate.jrxml is designed to be used as a Patient Form attached to a product - it picks up
the Batch and Reminder information.  

Both Sample Patient Form.jrxml and Sample Rabies Certificate.jrxml use the Letterhead facility introduced in 
1.9 and thus enable the one template to be used by different Practice Locations each of which have their own 
logo and contact details.

The A4 folder contains the A4 versions of the documents.
The A5 and Letter folders contain the A5 and US Letter versions of the jrxml documents.
