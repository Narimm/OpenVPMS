The samples here provide various patient, customer and supplier letters and forms.

Most are Open Office (.odt) documents, but Sample Patient Form.jrxml is a Jasper Reports template.

The Sample Patient Document.odt contains more complex examples.  It can be used as either a Patient Form or
a Patient Letter - or in fact any other Report Type.

Sample Patient Document.doc is a Microsoft Word document that mimics most of Sample Patient Document.odt.
It does illustrate that although you can use Word to prepare patient etc letters and forms, Open Office
is more powerful. (This is because OpenVPMS used Open Office to process .doc content, but does not implement
all of the mailmerge features available in Word.)
