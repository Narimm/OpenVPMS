OpenVPMS-Main
=============

The main project for openvpms.  This represents a FORK from the original OPENVPMS project hosted at 

svn://svn.openvpms.org/openvpms

However the code base here is rebased onto the master code on the svn repo as regularly as is required to keep up to date.  It might be a week or two behind in commits.


This project is the master project for OPENVPMS - the projects should be placed in a directory structure as follows

- openvpms	              Parent project. Contains common properties
- openvpms-framework		  OpenVPMS framework
- maven-plugins	        	Maven plugins to load archetypes, test data
- openvpms-archetypes	  	Business rules
- openvpms-reports	    	Reporting framework
- openvpms-sms	        	SMS support
- openvpms-esci-adapter		ESCI adapter
- openvpms-web	        	Web application
- openvpms-etl	        	ETL support
- openvpms-release	      Generates release distributions

OpenVPMS is a not for profit organisation built around the development and supply of open source 
Veterinary Practice Management Systems. OpenVPMS is owned by its members. A committee populated by members, 
manages its operation.

OpenVPMS is structured as a not-for-profit organisation whose members are comprised of;

Users of its products (eg. Veterinarians using the Open VPMS web application to manage their practices).
Developers utilising the open source code to create other products or add to the existing web application.
Interested parties such as associated industry (e.g. Veterinary pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, microchip registries and wholesalers).
Open VPMS is run by a board of Directors that manage the business from day to day. The Directors are either involved in or have an interest in the veterinary profession and contribute a mixture of vision, expertise, funds and industry knowledge to the overall goals of the Organisation.

There are no shareholders, as all profits can only be used to advance the cause of the organisation and it's members.
Pricing and subscriptions

Questions about pricing structure and subscriptions

What products will OpenVPMS provide for the subscription?
This is a key question as it goes to the heart of the vision we have at OpenVPMS.

OpenVPMS will deliver four key products via its open source subscription model. They will form a fully functional veterinary management software package for your business;

The OpenVPMS (Veterinary Practice Management Software) Business Framework
The OpenVPMS Web Application
The OpenVPMS Reporting Interface
The OpenVPMS Data Migration Tools
How can we be sure you will not increase subscription fees significantly?
We see the subscription charges being capped at a defined level with no more than CPI increase in any one year. Indeed if our long-term vision is realised it is likely that there will be LOWER subscription fees in the future.

How will OpenVPMS police subscriptions fees?
Although there are many technical mechanisms we could use to manage and force users to subscribe to OpenVPMS in the end it must come down to trust in the integrity of Veterinary Practices and their owners. We believe the value of what subscribers receive from their subscription will by far outweigh the subscription cost, encouraging participation.

How does the subscription fee work?
Subscriptions fees are based on the number of full-time equivalent vets working at the given practice and are paid annually.

Developers
Questions and answers from and for developers

How will you control the development and release of the open source products?

The open source process has been used widely and the process of selecting, testing and incorporating source code 
contributions has been well documented and tested. A key component of this process is the formation of a core 
committee of active developers who will make decisions on what is included, when and why. You could call this 
committee a benevolent dictatorship but we, and most other open source projects, see this as the only way to 
manage the development process effectively. Initially the committee will be made up of the initial core developers
and OpenVPMS stakeholders. As other developers and industry participants become involved in the project we see 
this evolving into elected technical steering and management committees involving this group as well as members of
the user community.

Will proprietary and open source developers need to pay subscription fees?

No. Proprietary and open source developers will not need to pay subscription fees. Everyone who wants access to 
the source code will need to subscribe to OpenVPMS but developers subscriptions will be at no cost. We believe this
is necessary to grow the developer network and encourage the delivery of new applications into the market. Our only 
stipulation is if a Veterinary Practice utilises an application based on the OpenVPMS open source software that they
are a current subscriber. I.e. the onus is on the user of the application to adhere to the license conditions.

Will existing proprietary software developers be able to use the Source Code?

The short answer is yes. We see participation of existing software suppliers as an important milestone in our vision
of delivering quality, open standards and choice to the market. We also see it as a positive for the software industry
as they gain significant cost benefits (designing, development, testing) from the utilisation of core software
components developed and tested by the open source community process. A major upside of their involvement will be 
their ongoing involvement in the development of the OpenVPMS kernel. As the OpenVPMS kernel will always be open
source and licensed to ensure that any developments are contributed back to all subscribers, this will be a positive
outcome for everyone. We will actively encourage other developers and business' to develop proprietary applications
that utilise the OpenVPMS kernel. Our only stipulation will be that any Practice or business that utilises the openVPMS
kernel pays their yearly subscription fee.
